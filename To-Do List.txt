Tasks to be done:

- Implement a function to check brute-force output against common English words to determine the success of a particular brute-force attempt.
    - This is bearing in mind the difficulties faced with the Unity device simulator being unable to handle the storage of 10,000-word lists in memory while running the program.

- Design and decide on a UI stucture to use for the app
    - Ensure user-friendliness
    - Ensure that the app does not require an overuse of tutorials for its functionality to be clear

- ADD MORE CIPHERS!

Optional tasks:

- Add a timer at the bottom of the screen that shows an estimated time for how long the current command is going to take
