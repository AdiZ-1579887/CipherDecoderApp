What is this? Who is doing this?

- This is an application developed using the Mobile Development libraries featured in the Unity Game Engine.

- This app is designed to encrypt and decipher phrases using common encryption methods. Common examples include the Caesar Cipher and Monoalphabetic Cipher (otherwise known as the Substitution Cipher).

- A 'Brute-Force' feature is also being implemented that will be able to utilize smartphones' ever-increasing processing power to crack ciphers, fully offline.

- Our group of four - Adi, Karter, Kavya, and Daniel - is working towards making this a functional app that can be released, initially to the Google Play Store and possibly to the Apple App Store in the future.

- We intend to submit this app to several upcoming app design challenges and hope to achieve high placements due to our early start on the project.

Roles:

- Adi - Lead Coder (does everything in Unity and converts pseudocode to C#)
- Karter - Researcher (finds commonly used and programmable ciphers to implement)
- Kavya - Pseudocode (devises the methods to encrypt, decrypt, and brute-force ciphers and creates pseudocode in Python)
- Daniel - Design and UI Artist (creates and proposes designs for a UI interface for the app)
