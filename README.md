# What is this?

- This is an application developed using the Mobile Development libraries featured in the Unity Game Engine.

- The app is designed to encrypt and decipher phrases using common encryption methods. Common examples include the [***Caesar Cipher***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) and [***Monoalphabetic Cipher***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher) (otherwise known as the _Substitution Cipher_).

- A [**Brute-Force**](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cryptography/Brute_force_attack) feature is also being implemented that will be able to utilize smartphones' ever-increasing processing power to crack ciphers, fully offline.

# Who is doing this?

- Our group of three - Adi, Karter, and Kavya - is working towards making this a functional app that can be released, initially to the Google Play Store and possibly to the Apple App Store in the future.

- We intend to submit this app to several upcoming app design challenges and hope to achieve high placements due to our early start on the project.

- This is the first mobile development project that any of us have worked on, and we're excited to continue as a group to create something that we're proud of and could potentially use in the future.

## Roles:

- Adi - Lead Coder (codes everything in Unity using C#, and works with Karter on UI design and implementation)
- Karter - Researcher (finds commonly used and programmable ciphers to implement, and works with Adi on UI)
- Kavya - Pseudocode (devises the methods to encrypt, decrypt, and brute-force ciphers and creates pseudocode in Python)
